  Raj Lamichhane
          I created threads to run the line follower and obstacle detection. The program uses the color sensor for line following that controls how the robot moves. The program also utilizes the ultrasonic sensor for collision and to avoid an obstacle while processing in real time.

          I helped debug the code and install the software environment, and then I verified that the line following and obstacle detection were working properly on the robot. I assisted in tuning the various sensor thresholds and motor speeds.

I did assembling the necessary hardware, all sensors and motors were connected, wired, and functioning. The color sensor and ultrasonic sensor worked and helped troubleshoot problems and assist with coding.
